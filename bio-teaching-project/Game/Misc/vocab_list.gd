	"Vasoconstriction" : "A decrease in the diameter of blood vessels caused by contraction of smooth muscles in the vessel walls.",
	"Diastole" : "The stage of the cardiac cycle in which a heart chamber is relaxed and fills with blood.",
	"Atrioventricular (AV) Node" : "A region of specialized heart muscle tissue between the left and right atria where electrical impulses are delayed for about 0.1 second before spreading to both ventricles and causing them to contract.",
